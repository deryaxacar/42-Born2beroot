## üéØ Project Purpose

The Born2beroot project aims to help participants develop the following skills:

- Installing and configuring a Linux operating system  
- Understanding basic network management and security  
- Using remote access methods (SSH, VNC)  
- Gaining knowledge in disk management and file systems  
- Managing users and permissions  
- Monitoring and analyzing log files  

## üîß Use Cases

The Born2beroot project runs on a Linux virtual machine and includes scenarios such as:

- **Creating and configuring virtual machines**: A virtual machine is created and its basic configurations are completed. Virtualization platforms like VirtualBox or VMWare can be used.

- **Basic installation of a Linux OS**: A Linux distribution is installed with basic setup steps including language, timezone, and disk partitioning.

---

- **Network configuration and security settings**: Configuration of IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS. Security settings include firewall setup, SSH access, and malware protection.

- **Creating and managing user accounts**: Admin and standard user accounts are created. Passwords are set, groups are created, and permissions are managed.

- **Disk partitioning and file system management**: Disk partitioning, formatting, mounting, and file system operations are performed.

- **Monitoring and reporting log files**: System log files are monitored and reported. Critical events are analyzed and troubleshooting is performed.

These steps form the foundation of the Born2beroot project and provide participants with in-depth experience in Linux system administration.
